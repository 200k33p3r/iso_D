This project includes codes to:

1. generate equivalent evolutionary phase points (EEPs) 
   from a set of stellar evolution tracks produced by MESA. 

2. generate isochrones from the existing EEPs

It is still very much under active development.  If you're
interested in using it, contact the developer.
